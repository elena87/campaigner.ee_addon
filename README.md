Campaigner makes it easy to subscribe members of your [ExpressionEngine][ee]
website to one or more [Campaign Monitor][cm] mailing lists.

Whatever your ExpressionEngine membership preferences, and however you've
configured your Campaign Monitor mailing lists, Campaigner just works, straight
out the box. And that includes full support for many
[third-party add-ons][docs_thirdparty].

Enter your Campaign Monitor API key, configure your mailing lists, and
Campaigner does the rest. You'll be up and running in minutes.
