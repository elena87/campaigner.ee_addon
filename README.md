## An Important Note About Support

Campaigner (in common with all of my ExpressionEngine add-ons) is no longer officially supported.

Check out the wiki for [installation and usage instructions][wiki], and feel free to fork the repo if you'd like to make some changes or improvements (it's distributed under a liberal open source license).

Hopefully this will be everything you need to use this add-on in your projects, but if not please don't email me asking for support; I don't even have ExpressionEngine installed locally any more.

## Overview

Campaigner makes it easy to subscribe members of your [ExpressionEngine][ee] website to one or more [Campaign Monitor][cm] mailing lists.

Whatever your ExpressionEngine membership preferences, and however you've configured your Campaign Monitor mailing lists, Campaigner just works, straight out the box. And that includes full support for many [third-party add-ons][docs_thirdparty].

Enter your Campaign Monitor API key, configure your mailing lists, and Campaigner does the rest. You'll be up and running in minutes.
